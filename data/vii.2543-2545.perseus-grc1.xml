                <p>This white marble sarcophagus is located in the Church of St-Luke, which is
                    itself on the outskirts of modern Thiva, where the village of Tabakides
                    described by Spon and Wheler used to be. The church was built upon the remains
                    of the precinct of Apollo Ismenius. Numerous later Christian burials are also
                    found in the area, which contain Late Roman pottery and early Christian lamps
                    (Keramopoulos 1924).</p>
                <p>According to a long-lived popular tradition, the sarcophagus contained the
                    remains of St-Luke. Because the saint, who practiced medicine, was thought to
                    have the power of curing diseases of the eyes, the top of the sarcophagus was
                    worn smooth by devotees who came to touch it over the centuries. The sarcophagus
                    is beautifully decorated. The operculum is made to resemble a covering of leaves
                    or shingles and a cross with spear and sponge decorates the front.</p>
                <p>In view of the location of the sarcophagus and the lettering of the inscriptions,
                    scholars are mostly in agreement regarding its date. Leake indicates that it
                    certainly dates after 300 AD, Kaibel assigns a date in the third or fourth
                    century, and Trombley opts for a date in the late fourth century, since,
                    following Vatin, he considers that the temple of Apollo Ismenius was probably
                    abandoned some time after the reign of the tolerant co-emperors Valens and
                    Valentinian I (364-371 AD), and then re-used as a Christian necropolis.</p>
                <p>The sarcophagus bears three inscriptions. On the right side, divided in two
                    panels, are found 10 hexameters (part α) and a rosette. The left side bears 10
                    more hexameters (part β), underneath which are found 8 trimeters (part γ). The
                    inscription suffered much damage over the years. In the early 19th century,
                    Clarke reported that the buttress of one of the niches of the altar of the
                    chapel was erected against the sarcophagus and left only a small part of the
                    inscription visible. Apparently, part γ was still clearly visible in 1835, when
                    Leake transcribed it. Further damage occurred over the years, and today, the
                    entire back section of the sarcophagus is integrated to the church wall. The
                    niche seen by Clarke also still stands on the right side of the sarcophagus, and
                    part γ (except for the first trimeter and about half of the second) is almost
                    entirely hidden by the rise of the church floor. Despite these issues, the text
                    of part α is securely established by DuLoir’s reading from 1654. Scholarly
                    editions include: Boeckh, CIG 1656 (only part α); Leake, Travels in Northern
                    Greece, vol. 2, p. 233, 1835, reprint 1967 (includes all three parts); Welcker,
                    Rhen.Mus. 4. 1845.236; Keil, Syllog. Inscr.Boet. 182; Kaibel, Epig. Graec. 502;
                    R. Ellis, Hermes. 14. 1879.259; Lolling I.G. VII 2543-2545.</p>
                <p>The sequence of the deaths commemorated by the three inscriptions on the
                    sarcophagus is controversial. According to Leake, Zosimos (1) commissioned the
                    first inscription (part α) for his son Nedymos (1). Then Zosimos (2), the son of
                    Nedymos (1), commissioned the second inscription (part β) to commemorate the
                    honors the city granted his father (a gold crown). Finally, the third
                    inscription (part γ) states that the sarcophagus contains the bodies of Nedymos
                    (1), his grandson Nedymos (2), and Nedymos (2)’s father, Zosimos (2).</p>
                <p>According to Keil (followed by Kaibel and Lolling), Nedymos (1) died first. His
                    epitaph is part β, which is therefore the oldest of the three. Then came the
                    epitaph of his grandson, also named Nedymos (2) (part α), which was inscribed on
                    the opposite side of the sarcophagus. Finally, Zosimos, son of Nedymos (1) and
                    father of Nedymos (2) died and was buried in the sarcophagus. His epitaph was
                    inscribed under part β, the epitaph of his father. Both parts α and β were
                    commissioned by Zosimos for his father and son, respectively.</p>
                <p>The language of the inscription is Atticizing and influenced by the traditions of
                    epitaph-writing as well as Homeric language. The expression γέρας ἐστὶ θανοῦσι
                    (part α, line 1) recalls the Homeric γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων (e.g. Il. 16.457) and
                    aeolic genitives are also found in part α line 9 (ἐμεῖο) and line 10
                    (ἀθανάτοιο). That the inscription was Christian is securely established by the
                    expressed belief in the soul’s departure towards its just place (or Justice
                    itself) in part α line 3 and in the immortality of the soul in part α line
                    10.</p>
                <p>This white marble sarcophagus is located in the Church of St-Luke, which is
                    itself on the outskirts of modern Thiva, where the village of Tabakides

                <p>The sequence of the deaths commemorated by the three inscriptions on the
                    sarcophagus is controversial. According to Leake, Zosimos (1) commissioned the
                    first inscription (part α) for his son Nedymos (1). Then Zosimos (2), the son of
                    Nedymos (1), commissioned the second inscription (part β) to commemorate the
                    honors the city granted his father (a gold crown). Finally, the third
                    inscription (part γ) states that the sarcophagus contains the bodies of Nedymos
                    (1), his grandson Nedymos (2), and Nedymos (2)’s father, Zosimos (2).</p>
                <p>According to Keil (followed by Kaibel and Lolling), Nedymos (1) died first. His
                    epitaph is part β, which is therefore the oldest of the three. Then came the
                    epitaph of his grandson, also named Nedymos (2) (part α), which was inscribed on
                    the opposite side of the sarcophagus. Finally, Zosimos, son of Nedymos (1) and
                    father of Nedymos (2) died and was buried in the sarcophagus. His epitaph was
                    inscribed under part β, the epitaph of his father. Both parts α and β were
                    commissioned by Zosimos for his father and son, respectively.</p>
                <p>The language of the inscription is Atticizing and influenced by the traditions of
                    epitaph-writing as well as Homeric language. The expression γέρας ἐστὶ θανοῦσι
                    (part α, line 1) recalls the Homeric γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων (e.g. Il. 16.457) and
                    aeolic genitives are also found in part α line 9 (ἐμεῖο) and line 10
                    (ἀθανάτοιο). That the inscription was Christian is securely established by the
                    expressed belief in the soul’s departure towards its just place (or Justice
                    itself) in part α line 3 and in the immortality of the soul in part α line
                    10.</p>
